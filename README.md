# Heart-Disease-Prediction-System
 In this project, I predicted heart disease using Machine Learning. After importing and analyzing data with plots, I generated dummy variables for categorical features and scaled others. I applied four algorithms, including Logistic Regression, and improved scores by varying parameters. Logistic Regression achieved 0.8512 accuracy.


Heart Disease Prediction System project:

Project Overview:
- The project aims to predict heart disease using Machine Learning techniques.
- The project involves importing and analyzing data, generating dummy variables for categorical features, scaling other features, and applying six machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest Classifier and Logistic Regression.
- Random Forest Classifier yielded the highest percentage of 83%, which revealed the best performance.
- The Logistic Regression model achieved an accuracy of 0.8512 (85.12%) in predicting heart disease.



Key Features:
- Data import and analysis with plots to understand the data
- Generation of dummy variables for categorical features
- Scaling of other features
- GUI uses of six machine learning algorithms:
-	Logistic Regression
-	Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
-	K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier
-	Decision Tree Classifier
-	Gradient Boosting Classifier
-	Random Forest Classifier
- Streamlit uses of six machine learning algorithms:
-	Logistic Regression
- Improvement of model scores by varying parameters

Technical Details:
- The project uses Python as the programming language.
- The dataset used for the heart disease prediction is not specified.
- The project Streamlit saves the trained Logistic Regression model to a file named "heart_disease_model.sav".
- The project GUI that trained six ML saved ”Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning.ipynb”

System Requirements:
•	Work on the windows, MAC OS, or Linux OS operating system.
•	Requires Python 3. 7 or higher
•	Needs the following Python libraries installed: Python libraries being used are pandas, numpy, scikit-learn and streamlit


Using the System:
1.	The specifics of the input fields of the patient medical attributes make up the face of the web app.
2.	Fill in the data concerning the patient in the respective boxes
3.	Hit the “Predict” button to test and use the model of predicting the heart diseases.
4.	The system will present the given result, which is the probability of having a heart disease or not among the patients.
5.	It also turns out that the application also offers graphical outputs to enable the interpretation of the results of the prediction.

Overall, this project demonstrates the implementation of a heart disease prediction system using machine learning techniques, with a focus on applying -	Random Forest Classifier in GUI and Logistic Regression in Streamlit Web and improving the model's performance through parameter tuning.
